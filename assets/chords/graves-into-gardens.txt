  INTRO

  1   4/1   1

  FIRST VERSE
  -----------
    4/1       1
  I searched the world
      4/1         1
  But it couldn’t fill me Blue
               6m
  Man’s empty praise
                     5
  and treasures that fade
             4
  Are never enough

  SECOND VERSE
  ------------
                 1
  Then You came along
    4/1               1
  And put me back together
             6m               5
  And every desire is now satisfied
             4
  Here in Your love

  CHORUS
  ------
              1
  Oh there’s nothing better than You
          6m
  There’s nothing better than You
                4
  Lord there’s nothing, nothing is better
       1
  than You

  INTERLUDE
  ---------
  1   4/1

  THIRD VERSE
           1
  I’m not afraid
     4              1
  To show You my weakness
                  6m
  My failures and flaws
                        5
  Lord You’ve seen them all
                        4
  And You still call me friend

  FOURTH VERSE
                         1
  ‘Cause the God of the mountain
         2m         1
  Is the God of the valley
                6m
  There’s not a place
                 5
  Your mercy and grace
                4
  Won’t find me again

  1                               4  1
    You turn mourning to dancing
                            4  1
  You give beauty for ashes
  You turn shame into glory
             6m  4       1
  You’re the only one who can (repeat line)

  BRIDGE 2

  1                              4  1
    You turn graves into gardens
                             4  1
  You turn bones into armies
  You turn seas into highways
             6m  4       1
  You’re the only one who can
             6m  4       1
  You’re the only one who can
